# Chess
Programming Chess in Unity entirely by Test-Driven Development

I've been learning a lot about Test-Driven Development, but I am still very new to the concept. I'm using this project as a means to learn how to use TDD in general and for Unity. I also only have a basic understanding of TDD and the three rules, and I have not done much research on the topic beyond that - so in some cases with my tests I may be overdoing it or underdoing it. I want to finish this project first, gain the experience and knowledge from doing it myself, and then read more on the topic to see what the best practices are and how I could have improved upon my own process.

I've decided to log my learning experience in the Personal Log file, so that I can reference it after I've finished the project and gained more experience in this programming style.
